# Mnss
A Java implementation of *Not the Maximum Segment Sum* problem.

**Not the Maximum Segment Sum** (**NMSS** for short) problem is an interesting problem from the context of [1].
In this short report I introduce how to compute NMSS problem in \textbf{liner time} and also introduce some concepts and skills of functional programming (FP). 
As a related topic the \textsl{Maximum Segment Sum} problem has been studied by many researchers [2-4].
